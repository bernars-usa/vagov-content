<p class="va-introtext">
As the spouse or qualified dependent of a Veteran or service member, you may be eligible for VA benefits, including health care, help with paying for school or training, and life insurance. If you're the survivor of a Veteran or service member, you may qualify for additional benefits, including help with burial costs and survivor compensation. If you're caring for a Veteran or service member, we can also offer you added support. Find out what benefits you may be eligible for.

We offer many programs and services that may help—including free health care and, in some cases, free limited dental care. We can also help you connect with resources in your community, like homeless shelters or faith-based organizations.

**Find the support you need:**

- **Call the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans** at 1-877-4AID-VET (<a href="tel:+18774243838">1-877-424-3838</a>) for help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You’ll talk privately with a trained VA counselor for free.
- **Contact your nearest VA medical center** and ask to talk with the VA social worker. <br>
[Find the nearest VA medical center](/find-locations/).

**Talk with someone right now:**

If you're concerned about a Veteran in crisis, connect with our caring, qualified Veterans Crisis Line responders for confidential help. Many of them are Veterans themselves. This service is private, free, and available 24/7.<br>
