## How many months of benefits can I get, and how long do I have to use them?

The amount of benefits you get (up to 36 months) will depend on how much money you put into your VEAP every month.

You have 10 years from your release from active duty to use your VEAP benefits. If you don't use the money after 10 years, you can ask for a refund for the amount left in your fund.

**Note:** If you’re on active duty now and want to use VEAP, you must have at least 3 months of contributions in the fund.

## Can I get the money back that I put into my VEAP account?

Yes. You can withdraw the money in your VEAP account if you don’t meet basic qualifying requirements or if you formally ask for a refund.

To ask for a refund, complete an Application for Refund of Educational Contributions (VA Form 22-5281).<br>
