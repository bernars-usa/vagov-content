<div class="va-introtext">

The Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) ended on November 25, 2015, but under the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016, some REAP benefits will remain in place for 3 more years. Learn more about what this change means for you.

## What happens if I've been REAP benefits to pay for my education since before November 24, 2015?

If you were already attending a school or training program on November 24, 2015, or during the last semester, quarter, or term ending prior to that date, you can keep using your REAP benefits until November 25, 2019.

## What if I applied for REAP benefits, but didn't start school until after November 24, 2015?

You're no longer eligible to receive REAP benefits. You may be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. <br>

## What if I applied for REAP benefits after November, 2015?

You're not eligible to receive REAP benefits, but you may be eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. We review your application and give you the benefits you qualify for.<br>

## If I was eligible for REAP benefits, but lost them when the program ended, how do I switch over to the Post-9/11 GI Bill?

You can credit your REAP eligibility toward your Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility if you meet both of the requirements listed below.

**Both of these must be true. You:**
- Established REAP eligibility before November 25, 2015, **and**
- Lost eligibility due to the sunset of that program on November 25, 2015

**If you credit your eligibility toward your Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility, you:**
- Will receive one month (or partial month) of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits for each month (or partial month) of remaining REAP benefits up to a maximum of 36 months
- Will not be eligible for 48 months of entitlement based on your previous eligibility for REAP and your new eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill
- Will be entitled to the 60% payment tier under the Post-9/11 GI Bill regardless of the length of your Post-9/11 active-duty service

If you'd like to switch your benefits, call 1-888-GI-BILL-1 (<a href="tel:+18884424551">1-888-442-4551</a>), Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. (<abbr title="eastern time">ET</abbr>).
