<div class="va-introtext">

If you're enrolled in a high-technology program with the goal of working in the high-tech industry, find out if you can get a single higher payment (called a "lump sum" or "accelerated" payment) to help cover the higher per-month costs for these courses of study.

## Can I get this education benefit?

Your eligibility depends on your service status, program, and tuition cost.

### If you're on active duty

You can get this benefit if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true:**
- You’re eligible for the Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD), **and**
- You're enrolled in a qualifying high-tech degree or non-degree program, **and**
-	Your tuition and fees are more than 200% of the monthly amount of educational assistance you would otherwise qualify to get during the certified enrollment period

### If you're in the Reserves

You can get this benefit if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true:**

-	You’re a current REAP recipient or a Reservist using the Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR), **and**
- You're enrolled in a qualifying high-tech, non-degree program that lasts for 2 years or less, **and**
-	Your tuition and fees are more than 200% of the monthly amount of educational assistance you would otherwise qualify to get during the certified enrollment period

<br />

**Note:** 
You can’t get this benefit under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA) program, or VEAP.
