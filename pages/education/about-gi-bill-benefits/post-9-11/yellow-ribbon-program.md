<h3 itemprop="name">Can I get this benefit?</h3>
<div itemprop="itemListElement">

You can get this benefit if you and your school meet the requirements listed below.

#### You must qualify for the maximum benefit rate under the Post-9/11 GI Bill

**To qualify, at least one of these must be true. You:**

- Served at least 36 months on active duty (either all at once or total over separate time periods), **or**
- Received a Purple Heart and were honorably discharged after any amount of service, **or**
- Served for at least 30 continuous days (all at once, without a break) after September 10, 2001 and were discharged after 60 days with a service-connected disability, **or**
- Are the dependent child using benefits transferred by a Veteran or a Servicemember who has served for at least 36 months on active duty and qualifies at the 100% level

[Find out about transferring Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits](/education/transfer-post-9-11-gi-bill-benefits/).<br />

**Note:** At this time, you're not eligible for the maximum benefit rate under the Post-9/11 GI Bill if you're an active-duty Servicemember or the spouse of an active-duty Servicemember. But, as of August 1, 2022, you may become eligible if you're an active-duty Servicemember who qualifies at the 100% level, or the spouse using the transferred benefits of an active-duty Servicemember who qualifies at the 100% level.

#### And your school must meet certain requirements

**All of these must be true. Your school:**
- Takes part in the Yellow Ribbon Program, **and**
- Hasn't offered the Yellow Ribbon benefit to more than the maximum number of students in their agreement with us, **and*
- Has confirmed your enrollment with us

[See the list of schools that offer the Yellow Ribbon Program this year](https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/yellow_ribbon/yrp_list_2018.asp). <br />

<h2 itemprop="name">What benefits can I get?</h2>
<div itemprop="itemListElement">

Money to help pay for the higher cost of tuition at a private school or for attendance as a nonresident student at a public school.

If you qualify, your school will contribute a certain amount toward your extra tuition and fees through a grant, scholarship, or similar program. We'll match the contribution.

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

### Apply for benefits

[Apply for Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits](/education/how-to-apply/). <br>
If you qualify for benefits, you’ll get a Certificate of Eligibility (COE).

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

### Turn in your COE

Bring your COE to your school’s certifying official, or to the financial aid, military liaison, or other office as determined by your school, and ask to apply to your school’s Yellow Ribbon Program.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

### Wait for a decision

**Your school will decide:**
-  Whether it has already enrolled the maximum number of students for the program period. Enrollment is on a first-come, first-served basis. We have an agreement with each school about on how many students may be covered each year.
-  How much funding you'll receive. Your school decides this amount by adding up tuition and mandatory fees, and then subtracting any specific aid you’ve gotten from other sources—such as scholarships or grants, as well as your Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition payment. Your school applies the Yellow Ribbon Program benefit to this final amount.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-four">

### Follow up

You’ll get a notice from your school about whether it has accepted you into the program and how much money you’ll get for tuition.

### Questions about how much funding you'll receive through the program

<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-1">Do all participants in the program receive the same amount of funding?</button>
<div id="questions-1" class="usa-accordion-content">

This depends on the school. Schools can choose to offer different amounts to students based on 2 factors:
- Student status (undergraduate, graduate, doctoral), **and**
- College or professional school 

**For example:** A school could provide $1,000 for undergraduates, $1,500 for graduate students and $2,000 for doctoral students. The
school also could provide $1,800 for students in the school of engineering and $2,500 for students in the school of nursing.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-2">Will all of my tuition and fees be paid for if my school participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program?</button>
<div id="questions-2" class="usa-accordion-content">

This depends on the agreement we have with your school. Your school’s agreement with us states the amount the school will contribute, and that we'll match, to make up all or part of the difference between what the Post-9/11 GI Bill will pay and the unmet tuition and fees charges. 

Your school's agreement may also state that they'll contribute only toward degrees at certain colleges and/or professional schools, and/or for undergraduate, graduate, and/or doctoral level programs. <br>

[Learn more about each school's agreement](https://www.benefits.va.gov/GIBILL/yellow_ribbon/yrp_list_2018.asp).

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-3">Can you give me an example of how the Yellow Ribbon Program works?</button>
<div id="questions-3" class="usa-accordion-content">
  
Yes. Let's say you're attending a public school as an out-of-state student. 

The school charges $10,000 per year for in-state tuition and fees, but $16,000 per year for out-of-state tuition and fees.

We'll pay the in-state costs of $10,000 under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. But you'll need to pay the extra $6,000 for out-of-state costs.

If you qualify for the Yellow Ribbon Program, you can get some or all of that extra amount paid. We'll match the amount your school contributes to the program. So if your school offers $3,000 in Yellow Ribbon contributions, we'll also pay $3,000 to the
school, and your full amount will be paid. If your school offers $2,000 in Yellow Ribbon contributions, we'll pay $2,000 to your
school, and you'll need to pay the remaining $2,000.

<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-4">Do I have to attend full-time to be in the Yellow Ribbon Program?</button>
<div id="questions-4" class="usa-accordion-content">

No. You don't have to attend full-time to be in the program.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-5">What happens when a portion of my tuition and fees is already met through state or institutional waivers?</button>
<div id="questions-5" class="usa-accordion-content">

We'll determine how much the Post-9/11 GI Bill will pay by subtracting any financial aid you have that's designated solely for paying tuition and fees from the total amount your school charges. Any unmet charges may be paid in part or in full by the matching Yellow Ribbon Program contributions from us and your school.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-6">What fees will the Yellow Ribbon funds cover?</button>
<div id="questions-6" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yellow Ribbon funds may cover any mandatory fees for your education program.

Yellow Ribbon and Post-9/11 GI Bill funds won't cover any fees that aren't mandatory, such as:
- Room and board
- Study abroad (unless your degree program requires the study abroad course)
- Penalty fees (like fees for late registration, returnd checks, or parking fines)

<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-7">Can I get Yellow Ribbon funds for the summer terms?</button>
<div id="questions-7" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yes, if your school still has Yellow Ribbon funds available for the per-student maximum contribution for the summer term.

### Questions about how your benefits may change from year to year

<div class="usa-accordion">
<ul class="usa-unstyled-list">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-8">If I participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program this year, will I automatically be in the program next year?</button>
<div id="questions-8" class="usa-accordion-content">

Not always. We require Yellow Ribbon Program agreements for each new year.

If your school has an approved agreement with us and continues to participate in the program, they must continue to offer the Yellow Ribbon benefits to you the next year as long as you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You**
- Make acceptable progress toward completing your program (accoding to your school), **and**
- Stay enrolled in the school without a break (following the school's policy), **and**
- Have money left under your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits

[Check the status of your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits](/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/ch-33-benefit/).

**If you transfer to another school**, the new school would have to participate in the program and accept your application. Your first school's decision doesn't affect your new school's decision.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-9">If I participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program this year, will I automatically be guaranteed the same matching contributions from the school and VA for the following years?</button>
<div id="questions-9" class="usa-accordion-content">

No. Even if you stay enrolled, keep progressing in your program, and having funding left under your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, your school can choose to offer a different amount each year.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-10">How will I know if the school I'm attending stops participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program?</button>
<div id="questions-10" class="usa-accordion-content">

Your school must notify you if they plan to stop participating in the program.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-11">If I take fewer courses, how will my payments change?</button>
<div id="questions-11" class="usa-accordion-content">
  
If you take fewer courses, we'll pay less toward your tuition and fees. Your school will also reduce the amount they pay. 

We base refunds on each school's refund policy. You'll need to pay us back for any overpayments we may have made to the school that they don't refund.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="questions-12">If I leave my school but return after a semester, am I still approved for the Yellow Ribbon Program?</button>
<div id="questions-12" class="usa-accordion-content">
  
If the school still participates in the program, they must continue to offer funding to you if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You**
- Make acceptable progress toward completing your program (according to your school), **and**
- Stay enrolled in the school without a break (following the school's policy), **and**
- Have money left under your Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits
