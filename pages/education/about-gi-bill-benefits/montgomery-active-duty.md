## What benefits can I get?

You may get up to 36 months of education benefits. We'll pay the benefits monthly. The amount you'll receive depends on these  factors:

- Length of service
- Type of educational or training program
- Your category (as defined above)
- Whether you qualify for a college fund or kicker
- How much you have paid into the $600 Buy-Up program

**Note:** You usually have 10 years from the date of your last separation from active duty to use your MGIB-AD benefits, but this may change depending on your situation.

## How do I get these benefits?

Follow the steps below to apply for these benefits.

<ol class="process">
  <li class="process-step list-one">
    <h3>Make sure we've approved your program</h3>
    Before you enroll, make sure we’ve approved your school for education benefits.
Contact the school or use the GI Bill Comparison Tool to find out if we’ve approved your program for VA educational benefits. 
[Use the GI Bill Comparison Tool](/gi-bill-comparison-tool).
If you still have questions about the school or program, you can submit a question to us using the GI Bill website. 
Go to the GI Bill website. 
If you or your qualified dependent want to enroll in a program that we haven’t approved, you’ll need to ask the school to request approval. We can’t take any action until an official from your school (not you) requests approval. If we don’t approve your program, you’ll have to pay all costs at the school, including tuition and fees.
