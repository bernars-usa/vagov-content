## Can I get education benefits through the MGIB-AD program?

You can get education benefits through this program if you were honorably discharged and you meet the requirements of one of the categories below.

### One of the below categories must describe you

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

#### CATEGORY I

**At least one of these is true. You:**
- Served for 3 years continuously (no breaks in service), **or**
- Served for 2 years if that was your agreement when you enlisted, **or**
- Served continuously (without a break in service) for 4 years—called the 2 by 4 program—if you entered the Selected Reserve within a year of leaving active duty, **or**
- Separated early for a qualifying reason (like a service-connected disability, hardship, illness, or injury that interfered with your performance of duty but wasn't caused by misconduct; or due to convenience of the government or a reduction in force in some cases)
- Are on active duty now (if you want to use your MGIB-AD benefits while on active duty)

**And all of these are true. You:**
-	Have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit, **and**
- Entered active duty for the first time after June 30, 1985, **and**
- Had military pay reduced by $100 a month for the first 12 months of service, **and**
- Didn't decline MGIB in writing when you entered active-duty service (unless you qualify under Category III or withdrew your election not to participate during the December 1, 1988, to June 30, 1989, "open period" for withdrawal), **and**
- Weren't commissioned as a service academy graduate or ROTC scholarship graduate (unless you received the commission after qualifying for MGIB or received a commission as an ROTC scholarship graduate after September 30, 1996, and received $3,400 or less during any one year of your scholarship program)

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

#### CATEGORY II

**All of these are true. You:**
-	Have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit, **and**
- Entered active duty before January 1, 1977, or you entered active duty before January 2, 1978, under a delayed enlistment program contracted before January 1, 1977, **and**

- Served at least 1 day between October 19, 1984, and June 30, 1985, and you stayed on active duty through June 30, 1988 (or through June 30, 1987, if you entered the Selected Reserve within 1 year of leaving active duty and served 4 years), **and**
- Had at least 1 day remaining of entitlement under the Vietnam Era GI Bill (Chapter 4) as of December 31, 1989

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

#### CATEGORY III

**All of these are true. You:**
-	Have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit, **and**
- Don’t qualify for MGIB under categories I or II, **and**
- Had military pay reduced by $1,200 before separation

**And one of these is true. You:**
- Were on active duty on September 30, 1990, and you separated involuntarily (not by your choice) after February 2, 1991, **or**
- Involuntarily separated on or after November 30, 1993, **or**
- Voluntarily separated under either the Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI) program or the Special Separation Benefit (SSB) program

</div>

<div class="feature" markdown="1">

#### CATEGORY IV

**Both of these are true. You:**
-	Have a high school diploma, GED, or 12 hours of college credit, **and**
- Had military pay reduced by $100 a month for 12 months or made a $1,200 lump-sum contribution (meaning you paid it all at once)

**And one of these is true. You:**
- Were on active duty on October 9, 1996, had money left in a VEAP account on that date, chose MGIB before October 9, 1997, and contributed $1,200 (we can collect the remainder if you didn't pay it all during service), **or**
- Were participating in VEAP on or before October 9, 1996 (even if you don't have any money in your VEAP account), served on active duty from October 9, 1996, through April 1, 2000, elected MGIB by October 31, 2001, and contributed $2,700 to MGIB within 18 months of the election, **or**
- Entered full-time National Guard duty under title 32, USC, between July 1, 1985, and November 28, 1989, chose MGIB between October 9, 1996, and July 9, 1997, and contributed $1,200 (we can collect the remainder if you didn't pay it all during service)

You may get up to 36 months of education benefits. We'll pay the benefits monthly. The amount you'll receive depends on these factors:

- Length of service
- Type of educational or training program
- Your category (as defined above)
- Whether you qualify for a college fund or kicker
- How much you have paid into the $600 Buy-Up program <br>

    <p></p>    
    <p><b>Note:</b> If you want to enroll in a program that we haven’t approved, you’ll need to ask the school to request approval.

## How can I use my MGIB-AD education benefits?

You can use your GI Bill benefits in many ways to advance your education and training. <br>
[Find out how to use your GI Bill benefits](/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/how-to-use-benefits/).

## More about how MGIB-AD works

<ul class="usa-accordion">
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="howmgibadworks-0">Do I have to have received a fully honorable discharge to qualify for these benefits?</button>
<div id="howmgibadworks-0" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yes. If you didn't receive a fully honorable discharge, you don't qualify for MGIB-AD benefits. "Under honorable conditions" and "general" discharges don't make you eligible for this program. <br>
[Find out how to apply for a discharge upgrade](/discharge-upgrade-instructions). <br>

If you have more than one period of service and receive an honorable discharge from at least one service period, you may be able to qualify if that period of service meets eligibility requirements.<br>

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="mgibad-works1">Can I still get these benefits if I'm already receiving education loan repayments?</button>
<div id="mgibad-works1" class="usa-accordion-content">

This depends on your situation.

**If you declined MGIB because you receive repayment for an education loan**, you're not eligible for MGIB-AD benefits.

**If you didn't decline MGIB and have received loan repayment**, you can still qualify for MGIB-AD. But we'll subtract the months counted toward your loan repayment from the total amount of MGIB benefits you can receive.

**If you receive loan repayment for one period of active duty, and you served an additional period of active duty**, you may still qualify for up to 36 months of benefits based on your additional period of active duty as long as you didn't decline MGIB.

</div>
</li>
<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="eligibility-1">How long will I be eligible for these benefits after separating from active duty?</button>
<div id="eligibility-1" class="usa-accordion-content">
 
In general, you'll be eligible for these benefits for 10 years from the date of your last separation from active duty, or until you use all of your entitlement, whichever comes first. Entitlement means the number of months of benefits you may receive.

We may extend your eligibility period for any of the situations listed below.

<b>One of these must be true to extend your eligibility period:</b>
- <b>You couldn't train for a period of time because of a disability or because you were held by a foreign government power.</b> In this case, we'll extend your eligibility period by the amount of time you were prevented from training.
- <b>You reenter active duty and serve for at least 90 days all at once with no breaks (not counting any period of active duty for training).</b> In this case, your new eligibility period will begin after your last separation from active duty.
- <b>You reenter active duty and serve for less than 90 days because you separate for a qualified reason.</b> A qualified reason includes a service-connected disability, a medical condition that you had before entering active duty, a hardship, or a reduction in force. In this case, your new eligibility period will begin after your last separation from active duty.
- <b>You serve 2 or more years on active duty and then 4 or more years in the Selected Reserve.</b> In this case, you have 10 years from your release from active duty or 10 years from when you complete your Selected Service period, whichever is later.

<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="mgibad-works2">Can I get the full amount of benefits if I leave active duty early?</button>
<div id="mgibad-works2" class="usa-accordion-content">

This depends on your situation.

<b>If you qualify for MGIB-AD benefits under Category I above with an early separation for Convenience of the Government</b>, you may be eligible for the full 36 months of MGIB-AD benefits. Note that to qualify under this reason, you must have:
<ul>
  <li>30 months of continuous active duty if your obligation was 3 or more years, <b>or</b></li>
  <li>20 months of continuous active duty if your obligation was less than 3 years</li>
</ul>
<b>If you qualify for MGIB under Category I above with an early separation for any of the reasons listed below</b>, you'll be eligible for less than 36 months. You'll earn one month of benefits for each month you served on active duty.

Reasons for early separation that fall under this category include:
<ul>
  <li>A service-connected disability</li>
  <li>Hardship</li>
  <li>A medical condition that you had before entering service</li>
  <li>A physical or mental condition that interfered with your ability to perform your duty and didn't result from misconduct on your part</li>
  <li>A reduction in force (RIF) in some cases.</li>
</ul>

<b>Note:</b> If you leave service early, don't assume your separation reason meets the requirement for MGIB benefits. Check with your education services officer or education counselor before you separate to make sure you don't lose your benefits.

<li>
<button class="usa-button-unstyled usa-accordion-button" aria-controls="eligibility-2">Can I qualify for more than one VA education benefit?</button>
<div id="eligibility-2" class="usa-accordion-content">

Yes. You may qualify for more than one education benefit. If you're eligible for more than one, you'll need to decide which to receive. You can't receive benefits under more than one program at a time.

We can help you make this decision. Call us at 1-888-GI-BILL-1 (<a href="tel:+18884424551">1-888-442-4551</a>), Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. (<abbr title="eastern time">ET</abbr>). If you have hearing loss, call TTY: 711.
