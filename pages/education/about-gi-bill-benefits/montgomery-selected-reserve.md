## Can I get education benefits under this program?

You can get education benefits if you meet the requirements listed below. 

**One of these must be true:**
- You have a 6-year service obligation (you agreed to serve 6 years) in the Selected Reserve, **or**
- You’re an officer in the Selected Reserve and you agreed to serve 6 years in addition to your initial service obligation

**Note:** Your obligation must have started after June 30, 1985, or for some types of training after September 30, 1990.

**And all of these must also be true. You:**
- Finish your initial active duty for training (IADT), **and**
- Get a high school diploma or certificate of equal value, like a High School Equivalency Diploma or GED, before finishing IADT (**note:** you can't use 12 hours toward a college degree to meet this requirement), **and**
- Stay in good standing while serving in an active Selected Reserve unit.

## Can I receive MGIB-SR benefits after I leave the Selected Reserve?

You can receive Your eligibility for this program usually ends the day you leave the Selected Reserve. But there are exceptions to this rule.

You can still qualify for MGIB-SR benefits for 10 years from the date of your first 6-year oblication (if you signed up before October 1, 1992) or 14 years from the date of your first 6-year obligation (if you signed up after October 1, 1992) if you meet either of the requirements listed below.

**At least one of these must be true:**
- You separated because of a disability, as long as that disability wasn't caused by misconduct, **or**
- Your unit was deactivated between October 1, 2007 and September 30, 2014, **or**
- You were involuntarily separated for reasons other than misconduct between October 1, 2007 and September 30, 2014

## How does the MGIB-SR work with the MGIB-Active Duty (MGIB-AD)?

- If you enter Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) status, we'll suspend your eligibility for MGIB-SR. You can qualify again if you return to the Selected Reserve within a year of when your AGR status ends. You may qualify for MGIB-Active Duty (MGIB-AD) based on your AGR status.
- If you elected to have your total service in the Selected Reserve credited toward your eligibility for the MGIB-AD "2 x 4" program, you don't qualify for MGIB-SR. This program allows you to qualify for the MGIB-AD with 2 years of active duty service without a break plus a 4-year Selected Reserve obligation as long as you enter the Selected Reserve within a year of release from active duty.
- If you qualify for MGIB-AD and then sign up for another 6 years in the Selected Reserve, you can qualify for both MGIB-AD and MGID-SR.<br>
