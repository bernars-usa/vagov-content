## Can I get education benefits under this program?
You can get education benefits if you meet the requirements listed below. 

**One of these must be true:**
- You have a 6-year service obligation (you agreed to serve 6 years) in the Selected Reserve, **or**
- You’re an officer in the Selected Reserve and you agreed to serve 6 years in addition to your initial service obligation

**Note:** Your obligation must have started after June 30, 1985, or for some types of training after September 30, 1990.

**And all of these must also be true. You:**
- Finish your initial active duty for training (IADT), **and**
- Get a high school diploma or something of equal value, like a High School Equivalency Diploma or GED, before finishing IADT (**note:** you can't use 12 hours of college to meet this requirement), **and**
- Stay in good standing while serving in an active Selected Reserve unit.

**What you should know about eligibility:**
- You remain eligible for 14 years from the date of your first 6-year obligation.
- You're still eligible if you were discharged from Selected Reserve service due to a disability, as long as the disability wasn't caused by misconduct.
- If you're ordered to active duty, we may extend your period of eligibility by the amount of time you were mobilized plus 4 months.
- If your unit was deactivated between October 1, 2007 and September 30, 2014, you'll keep your original period of eligibility.
