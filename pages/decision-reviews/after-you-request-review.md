When your review is complete, VA will mail you a decision packet that includes details about the decision on your case.
<br>
If you requested a decision review and haven’t heard back from VA within the expected time frame, please don’t request another review. Call VA at <a href="tel:+1phonenumber">1-800-827-1000</a>.
</div>

### What should I do while I wait?
<br>
You don’t need to do anything unless VA sends you a letter asking for more information. If VA schedules any exams for you, be sure not to miss them.

### What if I want to choose a different review option after I’ve submitted the form?

<br>
If you’ve submitted a form and want to change your review option, you have to send in a new decision review form within 1 year from the date on your VA decision letter or 60 days from the date you submitted your form. Please check your VA decision letter and be sure to request a review before the deadline.
