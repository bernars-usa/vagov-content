If you disagree with VA’s decision, you can request to have a senior reviewer take a new look at your case. The reviewer will determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error.

### Can I request a Higher-Level Review?

You can request a Higher-Level Review of an initial claim or Supplemental Claim decision. This option isn’t available after a Higher-Level Review or Board Appeal. It’s also not available if you’re one of multiple people claiming the same benefit (this is rare).
</div>

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?
<div class="card information">
  <span class="number"><span class="heading-level-3"><i class="far fa-clock" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"></i> 4-5 months</span></span>
  <span class="description">VA’s goal for completing Higher-Level Reviews is 125 days. A review may take longer if VA needs to get records or schedule a new exam to correct an error.</span>
</div>

### What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer?

If you request an informal conference with a senior reviewer, they’ll call the phone number that you or your representative provided on the Higher-Level Review form to schedule a time to discuss your case with you. The senior reviewer will try to reach you or your representative by phone twice. If no one answers, they’ll leave a voice mail. 

During the call, you and/or your representative can talk about why you think the decision should be changed and identify errors. There won’t be transcripts of this call.

### How do I request a Higher-Level-Review?
To request a higher-level review, fill out the Decision Review Request: Higher-Level Review (VA Form 20-0996). <br>
<a href="#">Download VA Form 20-0996.</a>

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

#### Select a benefit type in Part I of the form
The most common benefit type is compensation, but if you’re unsure, check your VA decision. You can’t select multiple benefit types. You have to complete a separate form for each type.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

### Optional: Request a call (informal conference) with the reviewer
<div class ="vads-u-display--flex vads-u-margin-y--1">

  </div>
</div>
<br>      
To schedule an informal conference, select times and list a phone number in Part II of the form. A reviewer will call 2-4 weeks after VA processes your request. 

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

### List the issue(s) you want reviewed in Part III of the form

You can include all or just some of the issues VA has decided. You’ll need to list the issue(s) you disagree with and the VA decision date for each.
