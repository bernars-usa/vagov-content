<div itemprop="description" class="va-introtext">
When you choose to file a Supplemental Claim, you’re adding new evidence that’s relevant to your case or identifying evidence for review. A reviewer will determine whether the new evidence changes the decision.
</div>

<span class="heading-level-3"><i class="far fa-copy"></i></span> You must add evidence VA didn’t have before that’s relevant to your case.

<div class="feature" markdown="0">

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

VA can’t accept your Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence.
- New evidence is information that VA didn’t have before the last decision.
- Relevant evidence is information that could prove or disprove something about your case.
- You can submit evidence yourself, or you can ask VA to get evidence, like medical records, that’s at a VA medical center or other federal facility.

</div>
