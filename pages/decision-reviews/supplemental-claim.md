<div itemprop="description" class="va-introtext">
When you choose to file a Supplemental Claim, you’re adding new evidence that’s relevant to your case or identifying new evidence for review. A reviewer will determine whether the new evidence changes the decision. Find out how to file a Supplemental Claim.

### Can I file a Supplemental Claim?

You can file a Supplemental Claim within <b>1 year</b> of a decision if you have new evidence.

But you can’t file a Supplemental Claim if you have a Fiduciary Claim or you’re one of multiple people claiming the same benefit (this is rare). <br>
[See your decision review options for a Fiduciary Claim](/fiduciary-claims/)
[See your decision review options for a Multiple Party Claim](/multiple-party-claims/)
</div>

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="card information">
  <span class="number"><span class="heading-level-3"><i class="far fa-clock" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"></i> 4-5 months</span></span>
  <span class="description">VA’s goal for completing Supplemental Claims is 125 days.</span>
</div>

### What’s considered new and relevant evidence?

**New evidence** is information that VA didn’t have before the last decision.<br>
**Relevant evidence** is information that could prove or disprove something about your case.

You can submit evidence yourself, or you can ask VA to get evidence, like medical records, that’s at a VA medical center or other federal facility. VA can’t accept your Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence.

### How do I file a Supplemental Claim with new evidence?
To file a Supplemental Claim, fill out the Decision Review Request: Supplemental Claim (VA Form 20-0995). <br>
<a href="/decision-reviews/forms/supplemental-claim-20-0995.pdf">Download VA Form 20-0995</a>. 

<ol class="process">
<li class="process-step list-one">

#### Select a benefit type in Part I on the form
The most common benefit type is compensation, but if you’re unsure, check your VA decision. You can’t select multiple benefit types. You must complete a separate form for each type.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-two">

#### List the issue(s) you want VA to review in Part II on the form

You can include all or just some of the issues VA decided. You must list the issue(s) you disagree with and the VA decision date.

</li>

<li class="process-step list-three">

#### Gather new and relevant evidence to submit

<span class="heading-level-3" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"><i class="far fa-copy"></i></span> You must add new and relevant evidence (supporting documents) or identify evidence you’d like VA to gather for review. 

**List the location(s) of VA evidence in Part III**. <br>
VA can help you get evidence if it’s at a VA medical center or other federal facility. For more details, see the instructions for completing the form.

**What if I don’t have any new and relevant evidence?**  <br>
If you don’t have evidence to submit, please select another review option.
