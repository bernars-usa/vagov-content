<div itemprop="description" class="va-introtext">
When you choose to file a Supplemental Claim, you’re adding new evidence that’s relevant to your case or identifying new evidence for review. A reviewer will determine whether the new evidence changes the decision. Find out how to file a Supplemental Claim.
</div>

<span class="heading-level-3"><i class="far fa-copy"></i></span> You must add evidence VA didn’t have before that’s relevant to your case.

### Can I file a Supplemental Claim?

You can file a Supplemental Claim within <b>1 year</b> of a decision if you have new evidence.

**Exceptions:** You can't file a Supplemental Claim if you have a Fiduciary Claim or you’re one of multiple people claiming the same benefit (this is rare). 

Learn about your Decision Review options if you have one of these types of claims: 
- [Fiduciary Claim](/decision-reviews/fiduciary-claims/)
- [Multiple Party or Contested Claim](/decision-reviews/multiple-party-claims/)

### How long does it take VA to make a decision?

<div class="card information">
  <span class="number"><span class="heading-level-3"><i class="far fa-clock" style="margin-right: 1.5rem"></i> 4-5 months</span></span>
  <span class="description">VA’s goal for completing Supplemental Claims is 125 days.</span>

### What’s considered new and relevant evidence?

**New evidence** is information that VA didn’t have before the last decision.<br>
**Relevant evidence** is information that could prove or disprove something about your case.

You can submit evidence yourself, or you can ask VA to get evidence, like medical records, that’s at a VA medical center or other federal facility. VA can’t accept your Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence.

</div>
