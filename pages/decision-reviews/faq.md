<div id="relevant-evidence">

### What’s new and relevant evidence?

In order to file a Supplemental Claim, you have to add evidence that’s both new and relevant. New evidence is information that VA didn’t have before the last decision. Relevant evidence is information that could prove or disprove something about your case. 

VA can’t accept a Supplemental Claim without new and relevant evidence. You can either submit the evidence yourself or identify evidence, like medical records, that you’d like VA to get for you.
</div>
<div id="missed-exam">

### What if I missed an exam?

If you missed an exam, you can ask for it to be rescheduled. You’ll need to file a Supplemental Claim and include a statement explaining why you missed the exam. VA considers this statement new and relevant evidence, which prompts VA to reschedule your missed exam.
</div>
<div id="duty-assist">

### What’s “duty to assist”?

The Duty to Assist means VA must assist you in getting evidence, such as medical records, that is needed to support your case. VA’s Duty to Assist applies during your initial claim, and it also applies if you file a Supplemental Claim.

If you request a Higher-Level Review or Board Appeal, the Duty to Assist does not apply. However, the reviewer or judge will look at whether VA met its Duty to Assist during your initial claim or Supplemental Claim, and if not, have VA correct that error by obtaining records or scheduling a new exam. Your review may take longer if this is needed.
</div>
<div id="miss-deadline">

### What if I miss the deadline?

Submitting your request on time will ensure that you receive the maximum benefit if your case is granted. Please check the deadline for each review option and submit your request before that date. 

If the deadline has passed, you can either: 
- Add new and relevant evidence and file a Supplemental Claim. Because the deadline has passed, the effective date for benefits will generally be tied to the date VA receives the new request, not the date VA received your initial claim. __Or__,
- Send a letter to VA requesting that it revise the decision based on a Clear and Unmistakable Error (CUE). CUE is a specific and rare kind of error. To prove CUE, you must show that the correct facts, known at the time, were not before VA or that VA incorrectly applied the law as it existed at the time. It must be undebatable that error occurred and that this error changed the outcome of your case. Misinterpretation of the facts or a failure by VA to meet its Duty to Assist are not sufficient reasons. Please seek guidance from a qualified representative, as you can only request CUE once per decision.  You can also see your VA decision letter for additional ways to address errors in your decision.

<div id="higher-level-review">

### What should I expect if I request a call with a senior reviewer on the Higher-Level Review option?  

If you request an informal conference with a senior reviewer, they’ll call the phone number that you or your representative provided on the Higher-Level Review form to schedule a time to discuss your case with you. The senior reviewer will try to reach you or your representative by phone twice. If no one answers, they’ll leave a voice mail. 

The informal conference, or phone call, must take place within the estimated decision time frame. During this call, you and/or your representative can talk about why you think the decision should be changed and identify errors. There won’t be transcripts of this call.
</div>
<div id="request-hearing">

### What should I expect if I request a hearing with a Veterans Law Judge?  

You have the option to request a hearing with a judge. A video conference hearing will take place at a VA location near you. 

At your hearing, you and the judge will have a conversation. The judge may ask you a few questions, but it won’t be like a cross-examination. The judge will talk to you about the evidence needed to grant your appeal. Your representative, if you have one, may help you at the hearing.

The hearing will be transcribed and added to your appeal file. You can add new and relevant evidence within 90 days after the hearing, but it is not required.
</div>

<div id="change-review">

### What if I want to choose a different review option after I’ve already submitted a form?

If you’ve submitted a form and want to change your review option, you have to send in a new decision review form within 1 year from the date on your VA decision letter or 60 days from the date you submitted your form. 

You can’t select a new review option if you’ve already submitted evidence or had a hearing.
