## Decision Review Options

### Add new and relevant evidence

The Supplemental Claim option isn’t available for fiduciary claims. You can file a new claim if you have new evidence. 
<br>

Please choose one of the options below for your next review.

### Ask for a second opinion from a senior reviewer

<a href="#">Download VA Form 20-0996 (Higher-Level Review)</a>

When you choose a Higher-Level Review, you’re asking for another review of the same evidence. A senior reviewer at a different regional office will take another look at your case and determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error.

### Can I request a Higher-Level Review?

You can request a Higher-Level Review of an initial claim or Supplemental Claim decision. This option isn’t available after you just had Higher-Level Review or Board Appeal.
