<h2>For Servicemembers returning home from combat</h2>

Find out if you’re eligible for health care benefits and how to transition to the VA health care program after separation.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What does enhanced eligibility mean for me?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

It means that you:
- Have up to 5 years after your most recent discharge or separation date to enroll in the VA health care program, **and**
- Will get free VA health care services and community living care for any condition that may be related to your service in combat, **and**
- Can start accessing your VA health care benefits right away, **and**
- Will be enrolled in Priority Group 6 (unless you qualify for a higher priority group), **and**
- Don’t have to share information about your income with us, unless you want to try to qualify for a higher priority group, beneficiary travel benefits, or free copays for care that’s not related to your military service

<div class="feature" markdown=“1” itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Do I qualify for enhanced eligibility?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

You may qualify if you meet all of the requirements listed below.

**All of these must be true. You:**
- Served in a theater of combat after November 11, 1998, **and**
- Were discharged or released from active service on or after January 29, 2003, **and**
- Didn't receive a dishonorable discharge

We'll use the documents listed below to determine your service in a theater of combat operations:
- Military service documentation that reflects service in a combat theater, **or**
- Receipt of combat service medicals, **or**
- Receipt of combat tax exemption, imminent danger, or hostile fire pay

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">What happens after my enhanced eligibility period ends?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

**If you enrolled in VA health care during your 5-year enhanced eligibility period**, you'll stay enrolled even after the enhanced eligibility period ends. 
But, we may shift you to a lower priority group, depending on your income level. This means you may start to have to pay copays for some services.

**If you didn't enroll in VA health care during the enhanced eligibility period**, you may still qualify for VA health care if you qualify for disability compensation for a service-connected disability or qualify based on your income. We encourage you to apply for VA health care within your enhanced eligibility period, even if you don't need medical care at the time.

<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Question">
<h3 itemprop="name">Will I have to pay a copay for care?</h3>
<div itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Answer">
<div itemprop="text">

As a qualified combat Veteran, you won't have to pay copays for care that's for conditions possibly related to your combat service. 

You may have to pay copays for care or services that we determine are clearly not related to your military service. 

If you want to be considered for cost-free care based on your income, you'll need to share your prior year gross household income with us for review.
